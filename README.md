# Task Management App

This project is a Task Management application built with React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to manage employees and tasks efficiently.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete employees
- Assign tasks to employees
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- Filter tasks by status (all, complete, incomplete)
- Search for employees and tasks
- Responsive design

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
   ```

````

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd todo-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Running Tests

To launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode, run:

```bash
npm test
```

### Building the App

To build the app for production to the `build` folder, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

### Ejecting

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

```bash
npm run eject
```
